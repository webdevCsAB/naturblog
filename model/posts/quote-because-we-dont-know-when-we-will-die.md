#QUOTE: Because we don't know when we will die...#

In a 1993 interview just prior to his accidental on-set death, Brandon Lee *(American actor and martial artist, son of martial artist and film star Bruce Lee. Born in 1965.)* quoted a passage from The Sheltering Sky *(the novel was adapted by Bernardo Bertolucci into a 1990 film with the same title)*. Lee had chosen this quote to be included in his upcoming wedding invitations; it is now inscribed on his tombstone:

> „Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, or five times more? Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless...”

\- Paul Bowles (The Sheltering Sky, 1949)
